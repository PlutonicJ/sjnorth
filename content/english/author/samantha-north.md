Hi, thanks for visiting my website.

I help governments, non-profits and brands track down online disinformation and coordinated inauthentic behavior. That includes fake social accounts, misleading narratives and harmful conspiracy theories.

My recent work on disinformation and election security has been featured in the Financial Times and the BBC. I have spoken about disinformation to both the UK Ministry of Defence and the US Army. 

I’m also in the final year of [a PhD in computational social science at the University of Bath, UK](https://www.bath.ac.uk/case-studies/bringing-interests-passion-and-expertise-together-why-i-chose-ido-for-my-phd/). In my research, I use a mix of data science and psychology to understand political tribalism in social media interactions.

My first research paper, _Battle for Britain: Analyzing Events as Drivers of Political Tribalism in Twitter Discussions of Brexit_, was published in August 2020 by Policy & Internet. You can [download a copy here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/poi3.247). 

I’m fascinated by the ethics of social media and big tech, especially where they intersect with politics. The concepts of [asymmetric reward and the dopamine loop](https://samanthanorth.com/disinformation-anticipatory-reward-and-why-we-should-all-quit-feeding-the-trolls/) particularly intrigue me. They are central driving forces in social media addiction, online trolling and our state of constant distraction.

In particular, disinformation takes advantage of an information environment where algorithms tap into our human biases and magnify them on a global scale.

I’ve worked in various roles before moving into my current focus. These include online marketing for a fintech startup in London and journalism in Istanbul. I have also worked as a nation brand consultant, helping countries and cities manage their global reputations.

I’m the founder of [Digital Émigré](http://www.digitalemigre.com/), a community for people building online businesses to emigrate abroad. 

I currently split my time between Lisbon, Portugal and Bath, UK.
